          diligence.
        </li>
        <li>Link risk assessment outcomes to AML/CFT controls and monitoring intensity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>4.2 Risk Categories</h5>
      <p>The Company evaluates risks across four dimensions:</p>

      <h4>6. Risk Appetite Statement</h4>
      <h5>6.1 Definition</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Risk Appetite</strong> is the aggregate level of risk the Company is willing to
        accept in pursuing strategic objectives, consistent with its <strong>risk capacity</strong>{' '}
        and <strong>regulatory obligations</strong>.
      </p>
      <h5>6.2 Principles</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Zero tolerance</strong> for ML/TF risk, sanctions breaches, or anonymous
          transactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited tolerance</strong> for operational risk, subject to effective controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prohibited</strong> activities:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul className={'ml-4'}>
        <li>Clients from FATF-blacklisted or UN-sanctioned jurisdictions;</li>
        <li>Shell companies with non-transparent ownership;</li>
        <li>Transactions lacking lawful economic purpose.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>6.3 Integration with AML/CFT Policy</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          High-risk clients automatically trigger <strong>Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)</strong> as
          per AML Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Risk ratings directly influence <strong>transaction monitoring thresholds</strong> and{' '}
          <strong>reporting obligations</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>7. Governance and Responsibilities</h4>
      <h5>7.1 Board of Directors</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Approves this Policy and reviews it annually.</li>
        <li>Ensures risk appetite aligns with strategic and compliance objectives.</li>
        <li>Receives quarterly risk reports from the AML/CFT Compliance Officer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>7.2 AML/CFT Compliance Officer (AMLCO)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Implements the risk assessment framework.</li>
        <li>
          Maintains the <strong>Risk Register</strong> (inherent, residual, and mitigated risks).
        </li>
        <li>Investigates and escalates high/ extreme risks.</li>
        <li>Coordinates with regulators (e.g., FIU) for SAR submissions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>7.3 Management</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensures employees adhere to risk controls.</li>
        <li>Provides resources for training, monitoring, and audits.</li>
        <li>Reviews risk reports and supports mitigation measures.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Conduct ongoing client monitoring and escalate red flags immediately.</li>
        <li>Complete required AML/CFT and risk training annually.</li>
        <li>Report suspicious activity to AMLCO without delay (“no tipping off”).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>8. Monitoring and Escalation Procedures</h4>
      <h5>8.1 Ongoing Monitoring</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Transaction monitoring:</strong> Automated systems detect unusual patterns (e.g.,
          structuring, rapid inflows/outflows).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Periodic reviews:</strong> Risk reassessment every 12 months (or quarterly for
          high-risk clients).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>8.2 Escalation Steps</h5>
      <ol className={'list-inside list-decimal'}>
        <li>
          <strong>Immediate escalation</strong> of red flags to AMLCO.
        </li>
        <li>
          AMLCO conducts preliminary investigation within 24–48 hours. If suspicion confirmed → file
          SAR to FIU (within 14 days max).
        </li>
        <li>Board notified of material risks or regulatory investigations.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>8.3 Coordination with AML/CFT Policy</h5>
      <p>
        All escalations follow SAR procedures described in the AML/CFT Policy (confidentiality,
        anti‑tipping‑off provisions).
      </p>

      <h4>9. Risk Examples</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Client Risk Example:</strong> High-net-worth client from a sanctioned jurisdiction
          → <i>Automatic rejection</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Jurisdictional Risk Example:</strong> Payment routed via high-risk offshore hub →
          <i>Trigger EDD and enhanced monitoring</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Product Risk Example:</strong> Large-volume cryptocurrency trades with
          inconsistent source of funds → <i>Intensified review and SAR consideration</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Operational Risk Example:</strong> Data breach exposing client KYC files →
          <i>Immediate Board notification and regulator reporting</i>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>10. Review and Update</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Annual review</strong> or earlier if regulatory changes or new products emerge.
        </li>

          Updates approved by the <strong>Board of Directors</strong> and communicated to all staff.
        </li>
        <li>Changes documented and linked to training refreshers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Annex: Risk Appetite Scale</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Low Risk (1–5):</strong> Acceptable; standard CDD.
        <br />
        <strong>Moderate Risk (6–8):</strong> Manage actively; additional controls applied.
        <br />
