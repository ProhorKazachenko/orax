      <h2>Conflict of Interest Policy</h2>
      <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        This Conflict of Interest Policy (hereinafter — the “Policy”) is provided to clients
        (hereinafter — the “Client” or “you”) by <strong>ORAX CORPORATION LLC</strong>, incorporated
        under the <strong>Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act</strong> and having its

        <strong>Marshall Islands, Majuro, P.C. 9696, Ajeltake Road No.1</strong> (hereinafter — the
        “Company”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this Policy is to identify potential conflict of interest situations and to
        establish measures taken by the Company to prevent or manage such conflicts in order to
        safeguard the interests of Clients and ensure fairness, transparency, and integrity in the
        Company’s operations.
      </p>

      <h4>2. Scope of the Policy</h4>
      <p>
        This Policy applies to all Company activities, its employees, independent contractors, and
        affiliated entities, including management of Clients’ funds, execution of investment
        operations, and interaction with third parties.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Definition of Conflict of Interest</h4>
      <p>
        A conflict of interest arises when the impartial and objective performance of the Company’s
        duties or those of its representatives is threatened due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>personal benefit (financial or otherwise);</li>
        <li>family or professional relationships;</li>
        <li>affiliations with other entities;</li>
        <li>any other circumstances that may influence impartial decision-making.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A conflict of interest may exist even when the Company derives no actual benefit, provided
        the circumstances create a risk of compromising objectivity and independence.
      </p>
